# automata-plotter
This project formats a finite automata represented as a edge list for display with Graphviz. 
It will work with deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata.

### To Do
* Expand README to detail how to run and how to use
* Add a version of the NFA-to-DFA algorithm to expand functionality
